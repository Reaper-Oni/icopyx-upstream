# Upstream information

As I pledged the iCopy-X Kickstarter and bought one iCopy-XS, in parallel to my [tear down efforts](https://github.com/iCopy-X-Community/icopyx-teardown),
I requested the vendor to honor the open source license of the Proxmark3 schematics and software and to share their modifications.

I will post here what I'll get and in parallel I'll try to create source repositories to enable some community development on it. Depending on what we'll get...

Timeline:

* 2021-07-01 Received hardware schematics
  * Available in [hardware](hardware) subdirectory, working on it in https://github.com/iCopy-X-Community/icopyx-community-hw
* 2021-07-02 Received reference to FPGA repository (https://gitee.com/kombi/icopy_fpga_3s_0921)
  * Mirrored as upstream in https://github.com/iCopy-X-Community/icopyx-community-fpga
